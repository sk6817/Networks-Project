## Barabási–Albert model

This is one of two computational projects from Complexity and Networks Module 19/20. Taught in the Department of Physics, Imperial College London.

Abstract: The degree distributions in growing network models were investigated analytically and numerically. The models considered were preferential attachment (BA model) and pure random attachment models. Both theoretical and numerical results were compared and found to agree with each other reasonably well. The BA model behaves like a power-law with an exponent of -3 for large degrees. Compared with the preferential attachment model, the degree distribution in pure random attachment model decays much more rapidly. In addition, an attachment model involving random walks was also simulated and studied. It was found that the degree distribution depended on the probability of continuing the random walk.

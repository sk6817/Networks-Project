COMPLEXITY PROJECT CODE
SUHASAN KANAGASABAPATHY

There are FOUR code(.py) files.

Code files:
  Simulation.py: Contains the functions for the models (BA and PRA), Runs the simulation and Saves it as a pickle file.
  Functions.py: Contains the functions needed in the analysis, to be imported later. 
                This file also contains the logbin.py code obtained from blackboard (NOT MINE).
         
  Analysis.py: Loads the saved pickle file, Contains the code for Task 2 and 3 (BA and Random attachment models).
  Random Walk.py: Contains the code for Task 4 (Random Walks).

BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE, PLEASE MAKE SURE THE LOCATION FOLDER IS CORRECT (FOR CORRECT IMPORTING).
